   * On every iteration, we:
   *   - increment cursor to advance to the next char in the cmd buffer
   *   - increment count to indicate we've stored another char in cmd
   *     (this is done during the loop termination check with "++count")
   *
   * To make the termination check work as intended, the loop starts by:
   *   - setting rv = 1 (so it's initially nonzero)
   *   - setting count = 0 (we've read no characters yet)
   *   - setting cursor = cmd (cursor at start of cmd buffer)
   *   - setting last_char = 1 (so it's initially not '\n')
   *
   * In summary:
   *   - START:
   *      set rv = 1, count = 0, cursor = cmd, last_char = 1
   *   - CONTINUE WHILE:
   *      rv (is nonzero) && count < MAX_INPUT - 1 && last_char != '\n'
   *   - UPDATE PER ITERATION:
   *      increment count and cursor

/* Parse one line of input.
 *
 * This function should populate a two-dimensional array of commands
 * and tokens.  The array itself should be pre-allocated by the
 * caller.
 *
 * The first level of the array is each stage in a pipeline, at most MAX_PIPELINE long.
 * The second level of the array is each argument to a given command, at most MAX_ARGS entries.
 * In each command buffer, the entry after the last valid entry should be NULL.
 * After the last valid pipeline buffer, there should be one command entry with just a NULL.
 *
 * For instacne, a simple command like "cd" should parse as:
 *  commands[0] = ["cd", '\0']
 *  commands[1] = ['\0']
 *
 * The first "special" character to consider is the vertical bar, or "pipe" ('|').
 * This splits a single line into multiple sub-commands that form the pipeline.
 * We will implement pipelines in lab 1, but for now, just use this character to delimit
 * commands.
 *
 * For instance, the command: "ls | grep foo\n" should be broken into:
 *
 * commands[0] = ["ls", '\0']
 * commands[1] = ["grep", "foo", '\0']
 * commands[2] = ['\0']
 *
 * Hint: Make sure to remove the newline at the end
 *
 * Hint: Make sure the implementation is robust to extra whitespace, like: "grep      foo"
 *       should still be parsed as:
 *
 * commands[0] = ["grep", "foo", '\0']
 * commands[1] = ['\0']
 *
 * This function should ignore anything after the '#' character, as
 * this is a comment.
 *
 * Finally, the command should identify file redirection characters ('<' and '>').
 * The string right after these tokens should be returned using the special output
 * parameters "infile" and "outfile".  You can assume there is at most one '<' and one
 * '>' character in the entire inbuf.
 *
 * For example, in input: "ls > out.txt", the return should be:
 *   commands[0] = ["ls", '\0']
 *   commands[1] = ['\0']
 *   outfile = "out.txt"
 *
 * Hint: Be sure your implementation is robust to arbitrary (or no) space before or after
 *       the '<' or '>' characters.  For instance, "ls>out.txt" and "ls      >      out.txt"
 *       are both syntactically valid, and should parse identically to "ls > out.txt".
 *       Similarly, "ls|grep foo" is also syntactically valid.
 *
 * You do not need to handle redirection of other handles (e.g., "foo 2>&1 out.txt").
 *
 * inbuf: a NULL-terminated buffer of input.
 *        This buffer may be changed by the function
 *        (e.g., changing some characters to \0).
 *
 * length: the length of the string in inbuf.  Should be
 *         less than the size of inbuf.
 *
 * commands: a two-dimensional array of character pointers, allocated by the caller, which
 *           this function populates.
 *
 *
 * return value: Number of entries populated in commands (1+, not counting the NULL),
 *               or -errno on failure.
 *
 *               In the case of a line with no actual commands (e.g.,
 *               a line with just comments), return 0.
